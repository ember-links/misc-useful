## Lazy loading images in viewport

> If you are looking for a responsive, lazy loaded artwork component that has fallback artwork and handles user monograms, take a look at the dummy-artwork component!  Also 3.5.8 released of ember-in-viewport.  I'm convinced this may be one of the more performance tuned, fully featured, battle tested viewport detection libraries out there.
